### Problem Domain Synopsis

We have decided to focus on the high-level domain of trust and engagement in local government. This problem involves a lack of participation of citizens in local government, and a general lack of awareness that many citizens show for the motions of their town/county councils. The goal for any solutions to this problem is to encourage higher attendance at public local government hearings and elections, increase interaction with officials, and promote better representation of constituencies.

We have considered other domains, and may shift focus to them in the situation that our current domain fails to provide substantive exploration. Our back up ideas include educating different age brackets on topics in which they are inexperienced, and addressing disability issues such as color blindness and deafness.
